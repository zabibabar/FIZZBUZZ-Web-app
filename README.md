# FIZZBUZZ-Web-app

A simple application used to implement the FizzBuzz challenge, with one caveat: instead of looping to 100, the current value is incremented via a button on the webpage. 
The user's score is be displayed on the page, and is updated after each click to display the user's current score. 

Additionally, NodeJs and express are used for backend development. User is allowed to login using a username and can resume playing the game after restarting the application.
